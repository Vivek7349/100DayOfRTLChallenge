# T Flip-Flop (Tff) - Verilog Implementation

## Overview
This repository contains a **Verilog implementation** of a **T Flip-Flop (TFF)**, a fundamental sequential circuit used in **counters, frequency dividers, and memory storage applications**. The **T (Toggle) Flip-Flop** changes state (toggles) on every clock cycle when `T = 1` and retains the previous state when `T = 0`. It also includes an **asynchronous reset** to initialize the output.

---

## Features
- **Positive-edge triggered** operation.
- **Asynchronous reset** to reset output (`Q = 0`).
- **Toggle behavior** when `T = 1`, making it useful for counters and frequency division circuits.
